# Jerboa

## A tiny programming language written in Lua

A jerboa is a small desert mouse, if you did not know. Read about them on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerboa).

Jerboa is the end product of a semester of assignments in CS 331, a programming languages class taught in the spring of 2019 at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The language was built over the course of three assignments, which were a lexer, parser, and interpreter, respectively. The specification was written by Dr. Glenn Chappell, who taught the class.

CS331 had two parts: 1) Fundamentals of programming language grammars, parsing, and interpretation, and 2) A survey of programming language paradigms. In the first part, we were taught Lua, and given the assignments described above with the goal of creating a functioning programming language at the end. In the second part, we were taught a number of other programming languages from other paradigms, such as Haskell (pure functional programming), Scheme (LISP languages), Forth (stack-based languages), and Prolog (logic programming). Our exposure to each of these other languages was brief, but informative on the many ways in which programming languages may be written, and the strengths and weaknesses of each.
